# OpenScan Hardware

This document describes our approach to documenting microscopes built on
optical breadboards for the purpose of sharing as open hardware.

As a concrete example, a basic two-photon scanning microscope is (to be)
described using the approach. It is hoped that variations, extensions, and
other designs (confocal, ...) will be added by us and othersâ€”the intent is to
provide something where people can contribute and also reuse as a baseline for
documenting microscope builds they develop.

**Current Status:** This is a work in progress. Many sections are incomplete.

```{danger}
You must follow good laser safety practices when working with lasers. You must
be fully trained according to your institutional policy and follow all
applicable safety guidelines and legislation. Among other dangers, the lasers
used here can do instant and permanent damage to your eyesight if not handled
correctly.
